<main> This is Eevee Doge, my German Shepherd Dog, or GSD.
  She is a very good girl, but can get into trouble at times!
She loves to play with the hose, and will try to bite the stream of water.
Her color is purple, because her parents' owners had named her Violet.
Someone had adopted her before us, but brought her back to the owners a week later because their dog did not get along with her.
My partner and I adopted her at 11 weeks, and she is now 2 years old! It's hard to believe.
Eevee can be very shy and suspicious of new things and people, but once she gets to know you she is excited to see you! </main>
